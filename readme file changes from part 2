Explanation of Changes from Part 2 to Part 3 

In Part 2, the code provides a straightforward menu and dish management system. Part 3 introduces more complex features, such as navigation enhancements, a more structured data model for dishes, a filtering mechanism, and improved back-navigation logic. Below is a breakdown of the main changes: 

1. Navigation and Screen Management 

Part 2: Navigation was managed by a single currentScreen state to track the active screen. 

Part 3: The navigation state is converted to an array (currentScreen), which helps manage navigation history, allowing for the ability to go back to previous screens using a goBack function. 

2. Data Structure for Dishes 

Part 2: dishes was a simple array of strings representing the dish names. 

Part 3: dishes is an array of objects, where each dish object includes additional details (name, description, course, price). This structure enables richer functionality like displaying prices and descriptions for each dish. 

3. Average Price Calculation 

Part 3: A new calculateAveragePrice function is added to calculate and display the average price of the dishes, enhancing the overview of the menu. 

4. FlatList for Dish Display 

Part 2: dishes were displayed using simple mapping with Text elements. 

Part 3: Dishes are displayed using FlatList, which is more efficient for rendering lists and adds the ability to delete dishes individually. A FlatList component also improves scalability as it only renders visible items. 

5. Filtering Functionality 

Part 3: A new Filter screen allows users to filter dishes by course (e.g., Starter, Main, Dessert). The filter is applied using FlatList to render only items matching the selected course. 

6. Enhanced dishDetails Input 

Part 3: TextInput for price includes keyboardType="numeric" for better UX, ensuring the price input is numeric. 

7. Refined UI Elements 

Part 3: New styles for FlatList items, delete buttons, and filter buttons make the UI more user-friendly and consistent. 

 

These modifications in Part 3 build on the basic structure from Part 2 by adding features that make the app more dynamic and flexible, enhancing both navigation and data interaction for a richer user experience.
